# Warnings Section

This section will continually scan the avatar GameObject's hierarchy for any typical avatar development issues that you otherwise might not know about or might forget about.  
Scanning will only occur while the section is open, and code is executed over time so as to not induce framerate lag / drops / spikes within the editor.
