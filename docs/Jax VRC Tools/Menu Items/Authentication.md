# Authentication

This button opens the authentication window, which enables you to log in or out of the program's paid features.  
You can subscribe to access paid features on either [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/BlackJaxVR) or [Discord](https://discord.com/servers/the-content-cult-673733355950571531).  
When you're logged in, this window will display your username from the platform you used to log in.  
  
When you log in, your browser will open an authentication page in your browser.  
This page requests access to parts of your Discord or Patreon account in order to verify you're subscribed.  
  
If you log in via Discord:  
- Username, avatar and banner: required to display your username in the window.
- Access to your email address: required to verify you're a real person, and is in no way stored or utilized further than checking if it exists.
- Know what servers you're in: required so the tool can check if you're in my server!
- Read your member info for servers you belong to: required to check if you have a subscriber role in my server.
  
If you log in via Patreon:  
- Not set up to work directly yet! Patreon authorization currently goes through Discord by assigning you a "Patreon subscriber" role.
